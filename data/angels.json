Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

We're seeking a talented, dedicated, and passionate Senior Developer to join our Product Team!\n\nIndustry and Organization History--\n\nHealth systems, as they exist today, exclude people from care. Half of the world’s population lacks access to essential health services. For many people, the nearest doctor or nurse can be hours, or even days, away, and the health facilities that are reachable are unaffordable, understaffed, and under-resourced. Gaps in health systems are bridged by approximately 1.3 million community health workers (CHWs) worldwide, who provide basic health care to local residents and link them to the healthcare system. Unfortunately, most CHWs are disconnected from the formal health system and are largely unsupported after a few days of pre-service training. Despite the rapid development of technology and communication infrastructure in these same parts of the world, technology is underutilized or ineffectively applied to support healthcare where it is most needed. When health systems are not designed to deliver care for patients, people lack access to quality care. Our founders were inspired to create Medic Mobile after understanding the daily efforts of CHWs caring for others, amidst these systemic challenges, in the poorest areas in rural Malawi. \n\nMission--\n\nMedic Mobile’s mission is to advance health and human flourishing with and for the hardest-to-reach communities. We envision a more just world in which health workers are supported as they provide care for their neighbors, universal health coverage is a reality, and health is a secured human right. Practically, we have advanced our mission by building, implementing, and supporting open-source digital tools that support CHWs, managers, and facility-based health workers. Along with our partners, we build and apply software that helps health workers deliver high-quality, equitable care in redesigned health systems. Our team and partners support more than 27,000 frontline health workers caring for an estimated 15 million people in 18 countries across Africa and Asia.\n\nYou:\n-- Are an experienced developer comfortable forging ahead independently as well as collaborating effectively with a remote team across many time zones.\n-- Can communicate effectively in English over video and text chats as part of a results-focused distributed team.\n-- Have developed, deployed, and maintained production web applications.\n-- Are productive in a UNIX-like environment, and can script your way out of trouble if necessary.\n-- Are excited to work with modern web technologies, NodeJS and CouchDB.\n-- Are capable of picking up front-end JS frameworks, even better if you are already a master with one of them.\n-- Enjoy working closely with designers and other members of a cross functional team to iterate upon solutions and solve problems together.\n-- Have a reliable fast internet connection and a quiet place to collaborate with remote team members.\n-- Can live anywhere, in any timezone, working hours that work for you, while being able to work with suitable overlap with teammates in Europe, NA, and NZ\n-- Are able to travel for 1-2 weeks a year for meetups and site visits.\n\nPosition Details:\nThe Senior Software Developer reports to the Engineering Manager, works closely with the Director of Technology and the rest of the cross-functional product team, and is responsible for the full development life-cycle of Medic Mobile’s web-based mobile health software.\n\nSoftware Development: 85%\n-- Design, build, document, and ship software that improves healthcare outcomes in underserved communities around the world.\n-- Work with Medic Mobile and its partners along the entire software development life-cycle: understand problems, capture requirements, design modular software systems, write great software, and document everything along the way.\n-- Participate in daily stand-up meetings, weekly iteration reviews, and monthly milestone reviews.\n-- Learn new languages, platforms, toolkits, libraries, tools, and application development paradigms as necessary.\n-- Contribute directly to open-source and free software projects as appropriate.\n\nStrategic Planning: 5%\n-- Work with the Director of Technology and development team to guide platform development and technical strategy.\n-- Evaluate tools and technologies; develop long-term software and platform roadmaps.\n\nTeam Support: 10%\n-- Consult on technical needs for larger-scale deployments, including local hosting, SMS aggregators, app scalability, etc.\n-- Work collaboratively with the rest of the product team to turn user insights into new features and interfaces that help empower our users.\n-- Work with regional tech leads in Africa and Asia on configuration of Medic’s toolkit as needed.\n-- Provide remote troubleshooting support to active deployments as needed.\n\nWe’ll be conducting interviews on a rolling basis.\n\nMedic offers a competitive non-profit salary and a comprehensive benefits package.

We're seeking a talented, dedicated, and passionate Senior Developer to join our Product Team!\n\nIndustry and Organization History--\n\nHealth systems, as they exist today, exclude people from care. Half of the world’s population lacks access to essential health services. For many people, the nearest doctor or nurse can be hours, or even days, away, and the health facilities that are reachable are unaffordable, understaffed, and under-resourced. Gaps in health systems are bridged by approximately 1.3 million community health workers (CHWs) worldwide, who provide basic health care to local residents and link them to the healthcare system. Unfortunately, most CHWs are disconnected from the formal health system and are largely unsupported after a few days of pre-service training. Despite the rapid development of technology and communication infrastructure in these same parts of the world, technology is underutilized or ineffectively applied to support healthcare where it is most needed. When health systems are not designed to deliver care for patients, people lack access to quality care. Our founders were inspired to create Medic Mobile after understanding the daily efforts of CHWs caring for others, amidst these systemic challenges, in the poorest areas in rural Malawi. \n\nMission--\n\nMedic Mobile’s mission is to advance health and human flourishing with and for the hardest-to-reach communities. We envision a more just world in which health workers are supported as they provide care for their neighbors, universal health coverage is a reality, and health is a secured human right. Practically, we have advanced our mission by building, implementing, and supporting open-source digital tools that support CHWs, managers, and facility-based health workers. Along with our partners, we build and apply software that helps health workers deliver high-quality, equitable care in redesigned health systems. Our team and partners support more than 27,000 frontline health workers caring for an estimated 15 million people in 18 countries across Africa and Asia.\n\nYou:\n-- Are an experienced developer comfortable forging ahead independently as well as collaborating effectively with a remote team across many time zones.\n-- Can communicate effectively in English over video and text chats as part of a results-focused distributed team.\n-- Have developed, deployed, and maintained production web applications.\n-- Are productive in a UNIX-like environment, and can script your way out of trouble if necessary.\n-- Are excited to work with modern web technologies, NodeJS and CouchDB.\n-- Are capable of picking up front-end JS frameworks, even better if you are already a master with one of them.\n-- Enjoy working closely with designers and other members of a cross functional team to iterate upon solutions and solve problems together.\n-- Have a reliable fast internet connection and a quiet place to collaborate with remote team members.\n-- Can live anywhere, in any timezone, working hours that work for you, while being able to work with suitable overlap with teammates in Europe, NA, and NZ\n-- Are able to travel for 1-2 weeks a year for meetups and site visits.\n\nPosition Details:\nThe Senior Software Developer reports to the Engineering Manager, works closely with the Director of Technology and the rest of the cross-functional product team, and is responsible for the full development life-cycle of Medic Mobile’s web-based mobile health software.\n\nSoftware Development: 85%\n-- Design, build, document, and ship software that improves healthcare outcomes in underserved communities around the world.\n-- Work with Medic Mobile and its partners along the entire software development life-cycle: understand problems, capture requirements, design modular software systems, write great software, and document everything along the way.\n-- Participate in daily stand-up meetings, weekly iteration reviews, and monthly milestone reviews.\n-- Learn new languages, platforms, toolkits, libraries, tools, and application development paradigms as necessary.\n-- Contribute directly to open-source and free software projects as appropriate.\n\nStrategic Planning: 5%\n-- Work with the Director of Technology and development team to guide platform development and technical strategy.\n-- Evaluate tools and technologies; develop long-term software and platform roadmaps.\n\nTeam Support: 10%\n-- Consult on technical needs for larger-scale deployments, including local hosting, SMS aggregators, app scalability, etc.\n-- Work collaboratively with the rest of the product team to turn user insights into new features and interfaces that help empower our users.\n-- Work with regional tech leads in Africa and Asia on configuration of Medic’s toolkit as needed.\n-- Provide remote troubleshooting support to active deployments as needed.\n\nWe’ll be conducting interviews on a rolling basis.\n\nMedic offers a competitive non-profit salary and a comprehensive benefits package.

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

From books to conferences, you’ll get a yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals.\n\n4. REMOTE WORKING\n\nBuild amazing things with autonomy, self-direction, and a healthy work-life balance. Don't feel like working from home? No sweat. We will pay up to $50/month towards renting co-working space in your city.\n\n5. HEALTHCARE\n\nWe provide comprehensive medical and life insurance for our fulltime members. We want to make sure that you don't have to worry about your life and contributing to things that matter.\n\n6. STOCK OPTION PLAN\n\nYou can own the company. As part of compensation packages, being the contributors you will be given the right to buy certain amount of company shares at a predetermined price.\n\n7. PROFIT SHARING\n\nWe offers profit sharing to employees if we gain significant growth that year. The more people who work at our Woodland, the more pieces of pie there are to distribute.\n\n8. STAY FRESH\n\nWork is a marathon, not a sprint. We work a sustainable pace of 35 hours a week, with the occasional emergency push demanding more. Working overtime sucks the spirit and motivation out of your team.

We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be \"pure.\"\n* Vision \u003e GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.\n* Writing \u003e Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.\n\nWe're working on:\n* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).\n* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.\n* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.\n\nWe work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers.

We are a social business, committed to profit-with-purpose. We believe that by solving one of the biggest problems for society we can make a globally successful business.\n\nWorking with carers from across the United Kingdom, we have developed an innovative approach for providing carers assessments on behalf of local authorities. Carer assessments are key because they unlock all the currently available support. \n\nWe’ve started the user-testing process, and have secured contracts with two local authorities. Now we’re in the process of building the technology behind the product.\nWhat you’d be doing\nWork and learn with us, in a friendly, open-minded, and dedicated team. We’re looking for someone keen to contribute and help us build a tech company from day one.\n\nDesign and implement rapid iterations of our MVP, building it to scale and extending features. We recognise the importance of responding to user needs. At this early stage we want to be creative in improvising tech solutions and testing them as quickly as possible.\n\nAs we secure investment, you will play a key role in recruiting the team to create a reliable and highly engaging beta product.\nThis would be a co-founder role, with clear potential to grow into a CTO role.\n\nWe’re pleased to be supported by some world-class advisors - Andy Crouch, Andy Skipper (experienced CTOs), Claire Unwin (and experienced carer and UX specialist) and Gus Maskowitz (tech generalist) - who will be on-hand to give advice and help untangle the knottier problems.\nThe Opportunity\nAlthough we’ve secured the necessary traction to indicate we’re onto something, we’re at an early stage. That’s why we’re looking for somebody to join as a co-founder, to help shape our vision of the future and design the road map to get us there.\n\nThe quality of data capture in the social care sector is poor. Our tool will be changing that by building up a substantial record of data on carers, how they approach their role and the kind of support that helps them. You will be building and leading the data science team that unlocks the insights the hold.\n\nAt the moment we’re keeping our technology simple - web-based chat engines - and focusing on nailing the user experience. As we bring more carers to the platform we want to be creative about how we use AI/Machine Learning to harness the collected practical wisdom of millions of carers.\nWho we’re looking for\nEven if you don’t quite tick all these boxes we still want to hear from you. We’re happy to support some on-the-job learning.\n\nWe’d love to work with you if:\nYou have personal motivation to help people in a caring role\nYou have some experience in a start-up team\nYou’re familiar with Javascript development and/or off-the-shelf chat-bot products\nYou’re familiar with, or ready to learn conventional machine learning approaches\n\nWhat we’d love to see from you is that:\nYou’re able to get started from the get-go\nYou’re happy to be both hands-on and strategic when needed\nYou are a great collaborator and are open to and keen to offer feedback\nIf needed, you are capable of setting healthy boundaries when there’s a heavy workload\nWhat we can offer\nAt this early stage we’re very flexible about the time commitment of the role. For now we think it could be done in two days a week, but would be happy to discuss what works for you.\n\nOnce we’ve had a chance to work together for a few months, and we’ve secured investment together, we’d look to have another conversation about whether you wanted to join full-time, and what kind of equity/salary package would work in the long run.\n\nWe’re currently based in Whitechapel, but most of the team work remotely.\n\nYou’ll have a role to play in defining our employee benefits, so if there’s something that’s particularly important to you that’s missing here, come on board and help us fix that!\n\nYou’ll be working with a team that values:\nEmpathy – For those we’re building the app for, for each other, and for ourselves.\nCollaboration – We choose to be open; when we share knowledge good things happen.\nHumour – To solve important problems we need to attack them with fresh energy.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1580726182,"locationNames":["London"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer-co-founder","title":"Senior Software Engineer \u0026 Co-Founder","compensation":"£0k – £40k • 5.0% – 20.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"5.0% – 20.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Mobilise","slug":"mobilisecare","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/7092132-8e31ebba8d24a9223e2a464edca7bb6c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1580727215","highConcept":"The informed friend for family carers","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1695","displayName":"London","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":6,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"5678558","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"475388","autoPosted":false,"description":"Northstar is a new kind of hybrid financial advisor — combining human financial experts with fully automated money movement. We guide you through key life events with Starter Packs that focus on the essential bank accounts. Then, each payday, Northstar calculates how much you can afford, and transfers the optimal amounts to pay off debt, save, pay bills, and invest. By combining the empathy of human advisors with the affordability of automation, Northstar democratizes the best financial guidance for everyone.\n\nNorthstar is a paid membership — you can sign up either as an individual or through your employer as a financial wellness benefit. We’re headquartered in SF, backed by top venture investors, and in market with paying customers.\n\nWe're looking to grow our engineering team at Northstar. As a software engineer, you’ll work on challenges unique to Northstar, including:\n• Building experiences that you are proud of – and can use daily to improve your financial life.\n• Crafting new features from the ground up to empower financial experts to do their best work in completely new ways.\n• Inventing and refining financial automation that directly improves people's lives.\n\nMission, Purpose, and Meaningful Work —\n\nWe founded Northstar on the belief that every person deserves the best objective, personalized, and affordable financial management. Banks and point solutions are biased, and therefore shouldn’t dictate how we use our money. In the face of overwhelming complexity, most of us do nothing with our money. This leaves 50% of Americans with less than $400 for emergencies, 50% without any retirement savings, and total student debt at over $1.5 trillion.\n\nWe founded Northstar to give everyone the full understanding and control of money they deserve. We’re doing this by creating a new default, where your money is automatically allocated with the expertise of a financial advisor, at an attainable and fair price. We hope to change our relationship with money from one of shame and ignorance to confidence and pride.\n\nEverything we do goes hand in hand with our core principles. Money must be:\n• Accessible: We make financial best practices and management available to anyone, regardless of income or upbringing.\n• Relatable: We’ll always design for how real people think, not how banks think.\n• Foundational: We believe in solutions that help you stand on your own two feet, rather than creating reliance on stopgap solutions.\n• Aligned: We’ll never profit from our customers’ confusion. We’ll only give recommendations and make decisions that we would give ourselves.\n\nNorthstar is an incredibly ambitious vision, and we’re looking forward to seeing how you can join us in striving for these goals.\n\nYour Key Responsibilities —\n• Architect and build features for Northstar users, participating from idea to production.\n• Take full ownership for engineering new solutions across all levels of the stack - Postgres, Rails, TypeScript, React.\n• Work directly with founders, and design team to reveal user needs and develop feature requirements.\n\nRequirements —\n• Software Engineer who is passionate about building quality user facing experiences.\n• Enjoy being a generalist, ready to learn and build with the right tools for each problem.\n\nBonus Points —\n• Experience with JavaScript (TypeScript, React, and GraphQL)\n• iOS or Android engineering expertise\n\nCompany Values —\n• See the Big Picture: We aren’t successful unless our customers are financially healthy.\n• Bias Towards Action: In the face of ambiguity, we take ownership and go the extra mile.\n• Diversity of Backgrounds and Opinions: A wider range of perspectives definitively results in a better result. The more voices, the better the ideas and execution. We’ve faced the same financial problems that our customers face.\n• Respectful and Upfront: The best collaboration happens in the natural tension of strong opinions, weakly held – when you respectfully speak your mind, and work together to as a team to achieve a higher solution.\n\nCompany Benefits —\n• We believe you do your best work when you’re not financially stressed, so we offer competitive cash compensation, significant early equity with fully transparent terms, and of course a free Northstar membership.\n• 401(k) plan with access to the best low-cost index funds\n• $100 monthly commuter reimbursement\n• 100% covered, top of the line medical, dental, and vision insurance\n• Flexible vacation policy, with unlimited vacation days and minimum vacation days\n• Flexible work-from-home / remote work schedule\n• A budget to customize your workstation exactly the way you like it\n• Proactive career planning with the founders","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1580408061,"locationNames":["San Francisco"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$100k – $160k • 0.0% – 0.5%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.5%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Northstar","slug":"northstarmoney","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/5678558-ef7631652933b40878502eff4f898c98-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1568929911","highConcept":"northstarmoney.com","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1692","displayName":"San Francisco","__typename":"NewTag"},{"id":"616175","displayName":"Remote","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":10,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"7390118","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"724416","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are seeking talented researchers and engineers who are extremely passionate to solve fundamental problems in blockchain and distributed systems.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nMasters in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, or a related field, or extensive practical experience.\n\nProgramming experience and proficiency in one or more of the following: JavaScript, Solidity, Go, Rust, C, C++, Python\n\nUnderstand the potential impact made by decentralization and blockchain technology\n\nIndependent and self-driven.

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems.

solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service.  That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G.  Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.  \n \nHowever, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point.  Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges.  Sitetracker is the only full-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.\n \nWe are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the #2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States).  Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people-first

At Origin, you will have the chance to work alongside and learn from startup legends like Yu Pan, who was one of the founders of PayPal and the first engineer at YouTube. You will also work closely with our founders (both developers) and other early engineers to architect and build out the Origin platform. \n\nOur work is not only open-source but open-collaboration too. Most of our conversations and engineering meetings are held in public. We use a lot of React and GraphQL at Origin. Our platform is built on decentralized technology (Ethereum blockchain, IPFS) so you will be expected to pick up new technologies if you do not have prior experience in them. You will have the opportunity to contribute across multiple projects, including:\n\n- Mobile apps for iOS and Android\n- Web3 Marketplace DApp\n- Libraries for third-party developers to build on\n- Our core platform (smart contracts and helper libraries)\n- Backend services like running nodes and indexing servers\n\nAs an early engineer, you will also be integral in setting both company and engineering culture and processes. You will represent the team at conferences and meetups and help us evangelize the Origin mission and technology.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- 5+ years in software engineering  (full-stack preferred)\n- Strong experience in Javascript is required\n- Experience with React and GraphQL preferred\n- Prior knowledge of Solidity or decentralized Web3 technology is not expected but will make you stand out as a candidate.\n- Bonus points if have demonstrated open-source leadership or been involved in a major open-source project\n- Strong written skills are particularly important as we are a distributed team\n- More than anything, we're looking for an experienced developer who is also insanely hungry to learn new technologies and shares in our mission.\n\n## How to apply\n\nOrigin has an untraditional application process. As an open-source project with over 100 contributors, we hire almost exclusively from our community. \n\nThere are no white-board interviews.\n\nInstead, we ask interested candidates to jump into our Discord, join one of our weekly engineering calls, pick an issue from our public project board and send us a pull request. Typically after two or three substantial pull requests, we'll get in touch with you to talk about next steps (usually a paid contractor role to further evaluate your skills and see if a fulltime role makes sense). At this point, you'll have a pretty good feel of what it's like to work with our team and will have been able to demonstrate your technical and communication skills. \n\n## Compensation and benefits\n\nYou will be paid a competitive salary, stock options in the company and a cryptocurrency grant of Origin Tokens (OGN). We offer health, dental, and vision insurance.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1513021264,"locationNames":["Boulder","San Francisco"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$100k – $160k • 0.0% – 0.5%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.5%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Origin Protocol","slug":"originprotocol","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/4962947-e8a373f92979b7779772ff9fa3a57fc1-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1513024631","highConcept":"Decentralized marketplaces on the blockchain","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1621","displayName":"Boulder","__typename":"NewTag"},{"id":"1692","displayName":"San Francisco","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":4,"jobListingsCount":3},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"4676490","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"280457","autoPosted":false,"description":"Javascript Ninja who can produce smart code.\n\nCan you write lexers (possibly parsers) for a custom language in JavaScript?\n\nDo you like writing your own code than spending time configuring large js libraries.\n\nCan you write your own visualization library (svg or canvas no problem)\n\nCan you appreciate how hard is to isolate state mutations and keep your views 'pure' in a complex application?\n\nPlease let us know your salary expectation when applying.\n\nFirst up - who are we not looking for:\n - People managers\n - Project managers\n - product managers\n - Leads or ‘architects’\n - Freshers/ Junior developers who have not exposed themselves to a lot of javascript code.\n - Folks who get bogged down by ambiguity or lack of office or amenities. \n - Cannot join us full time quickly\n\nNon-experienced folks, please do not apply.\n\nLooking for experienced developers who understand basics of computer science and love developing software in Javascript .\n\nYou are not in love with one framework or library. \n\nYou are comfortable ramping up on any technology, you hack , you write code, you look for elegant solution and you write code :)\n\nThe more experience you have the better.

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1692","displayName":"San Francisco","__typename":"NewTag"},{"id":"1848","displayName":"Copenhagen","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsCount":2},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"5921637","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"384439","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are looking for a superstar with years of experience programming in c++ in Unreal Engine 4.

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

In those 15 years we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.  \n\nWhat will you be doing?\n\nYou’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems. \n\nYou’ll also be helping to expand our product line.

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

There is also lots of opportunity to inject your creativity in almost any aspect of blockchain development, starting from the math components and finishing with user experience. While energy and enthusiasm are key, this is a position for **well-experienced developers only**.\n\n## Qualifications:\n\n- \n\nHave one or both of the following:\n\n  - Experience with WebAssembly and tools for WebAssembly compilation;\n  - Experience with code generation, compiler backends, JIT compilation;\n  \n\nAlso:\n\n  - The candidate should either know Rust or be able to learn it fast;\n  - Experience with C/C++ is a plus;\n\n  - Proficiency with multi-threading and distributed systems is a plus.\n\n## Responsibilities:\n\n- Extending various WebAssembly compiler backends and tooling provided by Wasmer and Wasmtime;\n- Implementing code generation and code transformation tooling for WebAssembly;\n- In the future, you might also be working with virtual machines from the blockchain space, like EVM and RISC-V VMs;\n- In the future, you might also be developing or extending a WebAssembly interpreter.\n\n## Ideal Candidate:\n\n- Worked 10+ years on the compilers, worked with WebAssembly, able to write Rust.\n\n## Get to Know Near\n\nNear is building the infrastructure of the decentralized web, including the NEAR Protocol smart contract platform and a variety of supporting tools. NEAR is a scalable blockchain designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption of decentralized applications. Unlike other next generation blockchains, this network has been built from the ground up to be the easiest in the world for both developers and their end users while still providing the scalability necessary to serve those users.\n\n## Working at Near\n\nAt Near, you have the chance to become an early member of a world-class team with significant upside. The opportunity we are tackling will completely reshape the landscape of the web for decades to come and potentially affect billions of people. We are funded by the top names in the industry and have attracted the best technical minds in the world to create a technology that will directly change the lives of billions of people.\n\nThis is a performance culture where you’ll be working alongside -- and learning from -- other top quality teammates executing at their best. We value boldness, ownership, transparency, curiosity and experimentation. We pay competitively plus we offer all employees full health benefits, daily lunch and a fully stocked office within walking distance of BART in SOMA.\n\nIf you’re excited by the challenge of winning in the fastest moving ecosystem as a member of its best team, this might be a good fit.\n\n","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1576114851,"locationNames":["San

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6944583","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"555296","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are looking for 5+ Augmented/Mixed Reality developer with experience of working with Hololens, Magic Leap, Vuzix.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1557845581,"locationNames":["Tbilisi"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$30k – $50k • 1.0% – 2.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"1.0% – 2.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Unleash AR","slug":"unleash-ar","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6944583-9aa46b7771fb79ca8b73ec619238b4cf-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1557844764","highConcept":"Unleash AR is implementing AI/ML into AR/MR/CV to enhance its' opportunities","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"3013","displayName":"Tbilisi","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":0,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"4076965","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"503184","autoPosted":false,"description":"AptResponse provides an personalized employee experience that help organizations increase employee engagement and productivity.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution).

After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6944583","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"555296","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are looking for 5+ Augmented/Mixed Reality developer with experience of working with Hololens, Magic Leap, Vuzix.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1557845581,"locationNames":["Tbilisi"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$30k – $50k • 1.0% – 2.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"1.0% – 2.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Unleash AR","slug":"unleash-ar","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6944583-9aa46b7771fb79ca8b73ec619238b4cf-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1557844764","highConcept":"Unleash AR is implementing AI/ML into AR/MR/CV to enhance its' opportunities","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"3013","displayName":"Tbilisi","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":0,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"4076965","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"503184","autoPosted":false,"description":"AptResponse provides an personalized employee experience that help organizations increase employee engagement and productivity.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6944583","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"555296","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are looking for 5+ Augmented/Mixed Reality developer with experience of working with Hololens, Magic Leap, Vuzix.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1557845581,"locationNames":["Tbilisi"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$30k – $50k • 1.0% – 2.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"1.0% – 2.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Unleash AR","slug":"unleash-ar","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6944583-9aa46b7771fb79ca8b73ec619238b4cf-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1557844764","highConcept":"Unleash AR is implementing AI/ML into AR/MR/CV to enhance its' opportunities","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"3013","displayName":"Tbilisi","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":0,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"4076965","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"503184","autoPosted":false,"description":"AptResponse provides an personalized employee experience that help organizations increase employee engagement and productivity.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6944583","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"555296","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are looking for 5+ Augmented/Mixed Reality developer with experience of working with Hololens, Magic Leap, Vuzix.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1557845581,"locationNames":["Tbilisi"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$30k – $50k • 1.0% – 2.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"1.0% – 2.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Unleash AR","slug":"unleash-ar","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6944583-9aa46b7771fb79ca8b73ec619238b4cf-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1557844764","highConcept":"Unleash AR is implementing AI/ML into AR/MR/CV to enhance its' opportunities","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"3013","displayName":"Tbilisi","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":0,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"4076965","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"503184","autoPosted":false,"description":"AptResponse provides an personalized employee experience that help organizations increase employee engagement and productivity.

With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution).

After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6944583","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"555296","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are looking for 5+ Augmented/Mixed Reality developer with experience of working with Hololens, Magic Leap, Vuzix.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1557845581,"locationNames":["Tbilisi"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$30k – $50k • 1.0% – 2.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"1.0% – 2.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Unleash AR","slug":"unleash-ar","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6944583-9aa46b7771fb79ca8b73ec619238b4cf-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1557844764","highConcept":"Unleash AR is implementing AI/ML into AR/MR/CV to enhance its' opportunities","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"3013","displayName":"Tbilisi","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":0,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"4076965","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"503184","autoPosted":false,"description":"AptResponse provides an personalized employee experience that help organizations increase employee engagement and productivity.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6944583","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"555296","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are looking for 5+ Augmented/Mixed Reality developer with experience of working with Hololens, Magic Leap, Vuzix.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1557845581,"locationNames":["Tbilisi"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"senior-software-engineer","title":"Senior Software Engineer","compensation":"$30k – $50k • 1.0% – 2.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"1.0% – 2.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Unleash AR","slug":"unleash-ar","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6944583-9aa46b7771fb79ca8b73ec619238b4cf-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1557844764","highConcept":"Unleash AR is implementing AI/ML into AR/MR/CV to enhance its' opportunities","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"3013","displayName":"Tbilisi","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":0,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"4076965","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"503184","autoPosted":false,"description":"AptResponse provides an personalized employee experience that help organizations increase employee engagement and productivity.

Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

we have a remote-first culture. \n\nAbout Us\n\nRoger was founded to make day-to-day financial operations like bill pay, expense management, compliance and bookkeeping as worry-free as possible for business owners, finance teams, accountants and bookkeepers. Roger works as an automated layer on top of a company's accounting software, saving businesses and accountants hours of work every day. We're proud of the product that we've built so far, and our 1,000+ global customers base agree that we're making something complex and tedious simple and maybe even fun. \n\nWe are backed by some of the best investors in the financial technology and just raised $7.3m. We have huge ambitions for our growth in 2019. But we are still a small team and therefore we want you to be part of the journey.\nJoining Roger will be chance to join a fast-paced company, with a global product. We hire for attitude and not credentials. Please apply regardless of your current position background, or experience.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer to run our integration efforts with our services. Our product integrates with a number of different services, such as accounting platforms like QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, as well as collaboration tools like Slack, Box and Dropbox. Allowing our customers to set up custom workflows that fit their exact needs is a core part of our product experience. We have an existing integration framework and a robust API in place, but we are looking to add a new team member to own the integration work end-to-end. This includes building new, as well as maintaining and improving the existing ones - all to ensure a stellar user experience.\n\nYou'll be working collaboratively with the rest of the engineering team as well as with the product team to drive the implementation and release of new integrations. You'll be familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end, and will drive positive change to Roger's engineering culture, processes and technology.\n\nWe see this role as a unique chance to own an important piece of the Roger product, see it grow, and flourish very quickly. \n\nYour profile\n\n- Excited to work on building the foundations of Roger's integrations ecosystem\n- Comfortable working with external partners and managing your projects from A-Z\n- Experience in working with object-oriented programming\n- Comfortable working with .NET and C#\n- Experience working with relational\\non-relational, Aurora\\MySql and Dynamodb\n- Experience with REST APIs\n\nThe Team\n\nThe engineering team is characterized by a high degree of support internally. We help each other out and pitch in when problems arise as well as give each other feedback to grow. Our top priority is to build the world's best financial automation platforms, while keeping our users safe and compliant. Scalability, reliability and robustness are keywords we live by but we also get excited about building out feature MVPs quickly to keep our innovative reputation with customers and partners alive and well at all times.   \n\nThe Stack\n\nRoger's backend is built on .NET with C#. We love the simplicity, speed and structure of C#, combined with the built-in security and robustness it offers developers. On the front-end we work in React and React Native, enabling us to build reliable web experiences that can handle high usage volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we make extensive use of Lamda (integrations only), AWS, Git, Bugsnag, Heroku and other great tools to keep our development processes running smoothly. \n\nOur Values\n\nWe're a global company with offices in Copenhagen and San Francisco. Our values are heavily influenced by our Scandinavian roots (both founders are from Denmark), and count humility, humor and inclusiveness. We strive to create a culture where anyone feels part of the family, and we place a great amount of value in hiring for attitude rather than resumes. We support flexibility in everyone's lives, and working at Roger can be easily combined with babies, toddlers and teenagers. We have two primary office locations but have a remote culture that we put a lot of effort into as we believe great talent can be found anywhere. As a remote worker you can be sure to feel like you are as much part of the team as those who come to an office every day. About every 6 months we all get together in person. Our last trips took us to Greece and Spain. Everyone on the team shares a passion for creating the best possible product and user experience, and that is something we value in future team members as well. \n\nThe Roger Story\n\nRoger's founders started the company after exiting their first startup to Cisco Systems. Having experienced all the frustrations with daily financial operations when starting previous ventures, the first gist of an idea for Roger was born in 2016. Since then, international investors from both Europe and the US have supported the growth of the team and the customer base, and the product is now used and loved by more than 1,000 customers worldwide. \n\nRoger is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to maintain and develop our inclusive work environment and welcome members of all backgrounds and perspectives.","jobType":"full-time","liveStartAt":1555718139,"locationNames":["San Francisco","Copenhagen","Remote"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"software-engineer-integrations","title":"Software Engineer, Integrations","compensation":"$70k – $140k • 0.0% – 0.1%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"0.0% – 0.1%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Roger.ai","slug":"roger-ai-1","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2742580-01a7b46d19641e7fdf57d7d7df283bce-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1559081704","highConcept":"Accounting automation tool for SMBs and Accountants","companySize":"SIZE_11_50","badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":11,"jobListingsConnection":{"totalCount":2,"__typename":"JobListingConnection"}},"__typename":"PromotedResult"},"__typename":"SearchResult"},"__typename":"Talent"}}},

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.

Right after I graduated from my Ph.D study, I started my own business. Being an entrepreneur is not easy, I spent countless time and energy to work. But it is a truly rewarding journey, and I gained some valuable experience in manufacturing, management, marketing and distribution. The Success of my 1st company has enabled me to have the opportunity to seek my real passion: innovation for home. With the emerging of Smart devices, such as smart light, smart switch and smart speaker, I believe smart home technology has a great potential and will play an essential role in our future life. And I want to be a part of it, that is, to build a smart home product that can help people save energy and make our everyday life pleasant and more enjoyable. With this goal in mind, I began to build a smart home prototype to put my vision into real project. After numerous try out and lots of updates, the prototype is ready and its user experience lives beyond my expectation. I believe it is time to have a CTO/Co-founder join me so together we can launch our product to the market and build something great of the home automation market. \n\nWhat we have done so far:\nHas built and launched a prototype;\niOS app prototype ready;\nExtensively tested the prototype;\n\nAs CTO/Co-founder Your primary responsibility will be: \nProduct Development based on the prototype;\nFirmware and PCB development;\nMobile App building and Server deployment;\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nEquity ONLY (\u003e20%, depending on your contribution). What I am looking for is a tech partner/co-founder, not an employee. \n\nPotential candidate:\nPassionate about iOT and consumer technology;\nEager to learn and embrace challenge;\nDesire entrepreneurship and has the ambition to build something valuable in your future life;\nWilling to have a serious and long term commitment into this partnership\n\n\nQ\u0026A:\n\nWhat kind of mind set do I need to have?\n\nBeing entrepreneur is not easy, it can be lonely, frustrated, and even hopeless sometimes, so be prepared for it. After all, success requires persistence, persistence, and persistence.\n\n\nDo I need to invest once I commit to join as a co-founder?\n\nFor the early stage, I have enough resources for the product development, as well as bringing the final product to market. You are welcome to invest any amount you want since you will be the founder of our company. But it is not necessary and is totally up to you.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to launch the product?\n\nGenerally, we can expect to launch the product to market in about six months as the prototype was built already. Hopefully we can see the positive cash flow within a year. Again, it depends on our development process and how much time and effort we put in. \n\n\nCan I be part time as a co-founder?\n\nIt will only work for a short period of time if that is necessary for you. Once our development is on track, I believe full time is required. Being laser-focused and hardworking is the only way to make our dream come true. \n\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to have?\n\nAs a tech cofounder, you will focus on technological development, firmware, PCB design, mobile app\u0026server deployment. You don’t have to master every single detail right now, and you should have a vision that your skills will be kept up with our development process to fulfill all tasks coming along.","jobType":"cofounder","liveStartAt":1534379987,"locationNames":["Los Angeles"],"primaryRoleTitle":"Software Engineer","remote":true,"slug":"cto-co-founder-needed","title":"CTO/ Co-founder needed","compensation":"No salary • 20.0% – 35.0%","estimatedSalary":null,"equity":"20.0% – 35.0%","usesEstimatedSalary":false}],"currentUserHasStarred":false,"name":"Homey Technology","slug":"homey-technology","logoUrl":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/6169660-697679aaf70d0ee41625a1866b91ac9c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1534379985","highConcept":"Pleasant home living with easy “set it forget it” automation","companySize":"SIZE_1_10","locationTaggings":[{"id":"1653","displayName":"Los Angeles","__typename":"NewTag"}],"badges":[],"applicantsInPastWeek":1,"jobListingsCount":1},"__typename":"StartupSearchResultEdge"},{"node":{"__typename":"StartupSearchResult","id":"6853453","highlightedJobListings":[{"__typename":"JobListingSearchResult","id":"530376","autoPosted":false,"description":"We are currently looking for theses qualities/skills in a CTO:\n\n1.
